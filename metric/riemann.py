"""Non Euclidean Geometry:

Here we need to add a metric tensor, plus raising an lower indices--
not sure what to do, other than replacing the dot product--

So the idea is: have a metric tensor, much like an ellipsoid,
can define the vectors on that.... module needs work.

Then, we would address upper and lower indices vias case:

T.Ii is a trace:

T.IJK vs. T.ijk are co(ontra)variant tensors.

T.Ijk is mixed.
